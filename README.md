## Describes what the program does:
Think of simulating a security installation very similar to those installed in many offices and homes. The installation has a keypad and an engine (a controller) used to decide whether the user has entered the correct access code or not.

The keypad has ten keys, labeled from '0' to '9'. The security engine will unlock the lock when it finds the correct un-locking access code in the input string. Likewise, the security engine will lock the lock when it finds the correct locking access code in the input string.

DDDDD1 is the unlocking code
DDDDD4 is the locking code, where DDDDD are the lest significant five digits in your student ID. (59823)
As soon as the last digit of the access code is entered, your program will signal the action taken (lock or unlock).

## How to build and run the executable:
